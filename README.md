# Web Accessibility in JavaScript Apps

_The web is awesome and everyone should be able to enjoy it._

Hi there! I'm [Sandrina Pereira](https://twitter.com/a_sandrina_p) and I believe that making the web accessible is our duty as web creators.

## Developer extensions

We'll explore some browser extensions:

The ones below we'll use frequently:

- [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/downloads/) - Chrome only
- [Axe Developer Tools](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) - Chrome or Firefox. This is the alternative, but the extension above is more complete.

At some point, we'll might also use the following:

- [Colour contrast checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) - Chrome only
- [HeadingsMap](https://rumoroso.bitbucket.io/) - Chrome or Firefox

## Screen Readers

We'll explore SR (Screen Reader), however during a remote workshop it's not practical to teach everyone how to use a SR. Here's some friendly video tutorials for you to practice in the meantime:

- Mac: You'll use VO (Voice Over) [Watch VO introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&t=198s).
- Windows: Install [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [watch NVDA introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU).
- Linux: Install [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) and [watch Orca introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWSztc3AtY).

My favorite cheatsheet of keyboard shortcuts:

- [VO and NVDA cheatsheet](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/survival-guide)
- [Orca cheatsheet](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/commands_controlling_orca.html.en).

I encourage you to [practice with this playground](https://sgwvk.csb.app/).

**Tip:** While the SR is speaking, press `Control` key to force it to stop reading it. This might help you to reduce the annoying/frustration feeling while exploring it.

Good luck ðŸ¤ž
